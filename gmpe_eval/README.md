This file takes in two ShakeMap grid.xyz files. It takes an observed file which was generated by the ShakeMap software for an actual event. We then generate a new file for the same quake in our testing system and compare the two results. The data will give us false and true positives to plot an ROC curve. In statistics, a receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. For more on ROC, please see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic](Receiver Operating Charactertics)
